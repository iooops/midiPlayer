# Midi Player On the Web/Drive

## Motivation
Wanted to do a project for music generation with friends and uploaded a lot of MIDI files to google drive but cannot open them in the drive directly. 

So there's a need to build a drive plugin for opening midi files.

## Desired functionality

- play/pause/stop midi files with right instrumental sounds loaded
- have a visulization of the midi file (would be good to have a piano roll)
	- instruments
	- pitch
	- velocity
	- techniques(modulation, etc.)?
- show the raw data of the midi file
- show the parsed midi information [http://www.ccarh.org/courses/253/handout/bytetable/bytelist.pdf](http://www.ccarh.org/courses/253/handout/bytetable/bytelist.pdf)
- integrate with google drive * 

More to go if having time:

- control playback tempo
- modify the original midi file
